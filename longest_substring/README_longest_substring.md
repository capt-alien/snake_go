# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

This is a classic sliding window problem that tests your ability to:
- Track characters efficiently
- Move a dynamic window across the input string
- Handle edge cases like empty input or repeated characters

## Examples
