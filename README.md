# 🐍 snake_go

This repo tracks my journey learning and mastering backend development in Go, one coding problem at a time.

Each folder contains Go solutions to classic data structures, algorithms, and system design problems — all solved from scratch and tested. The goal: sharpen my Go fluency and prepare for backend/system design interviews.

## 🔧 What You'll Find

- ✅ Idiomatic Go solutions to DSA problems (starting with strings, maps, arrays, etc.)
- ✅ Focus on correctness, clarity, and testability
- ✅ Problems solved in Python first (if needed), then ported to Go
- ✅ Frequent use of `[]rune`, `map[rune]int`, and real-world patterns like counting, indexing, and error handling


💥 Why “snake_go”?

Because I’m porting my Python (🐍) knowledge into Go (🐹), one problem at a time — and leaving a trail of clean code behind me.

⸻

This repo is part of my prep for backend/SRE roles where Go is used in production.
